#Problem 11. Programming Languages
#Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with information about the most popular programming languages. 
#How similar are they to C#? How do they differ from C#?

C++       
===
Similar to C# in many ways, (e.g. it is object-oriented, functional), as it influenced the development of other languages including C#.
Different from C# in that it compiles to native code, and is therefore faster (games and core components of operating systems are usually written in C++). 


Java
===
Similar to C# in runtime compilation, strongly typed, class-based, object-oriented. C# is basically Microsoft's answer to Oracle's Java. 
Java is different from C# in that it is older by 7 years, is much more portable, being available on all platforms, and is very widespread in the enterprise.  Often used in embedded systems.


Javascript
===
Similar to C# in that recent browsers do just-in-time compilation of Javascript. Both languages are interpreted, object-oriented, functional, imperative.
Different from C# in that it is interpreted in the browser. It used to be mostly used for web, but recently it is becoming popular in server-client applications because of it's "always-listening" architecture.


Ruby
===
Similar to C# in that it needs an interpreter to run. Both languages are object-oriented, functional,  and imperative.
Different from C# in that C# is a runtime-compiled language, while Ruby is an interpreted language. C# code is faster than Ruby. Ruby has a quite a lot of frameworks built on top of it (e.g. Ruby on Rails).

PHP
===
Similar to C# in that it is an object-oriented, functional language, and that it needs an interpreter.
Different from C# in that it is a server-side scripting language (like ASP) and is most known for web development, although it can also be a general-purpose programming language (e.g. for Mobile Apps). Unlike C#, PHP is a also a procedural language, although recently it is moving more towards object-oriented programming.

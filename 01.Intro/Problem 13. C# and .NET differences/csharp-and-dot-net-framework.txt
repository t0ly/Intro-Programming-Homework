C# is a programming language, and its code is compiled into an intermediate language called managed assembly, which in turn is compiled by the .NET framework into native machine instructions.  

The .NET framework also contains an extensive library of classes organized into namespaces that provide a lot of day-to-day functionality (e.g. String Operations, I/O, XML parsing) to build useful programs faster.
